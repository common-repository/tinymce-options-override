== Installation ==

1. Upload `tiny_mce_options_override` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I set these options on a per user basis? =

As of version 1.0, yes you can. You can set a User's options on their profile edit page. Alternatively you can set a User to use the Global Settings by ticking the corresponding box on the same page.

= Can a user change their own settings? =

No, as this would defeat the object of the plugin. No user (including Administrators) can change their own settings.

= Who can change the Global Settings? =

Only an Aministrator can change the Global Settings, these can be found under the "Settings" heading.

= Can I reposition the TinyMCE Buttons? =

Not yet, however this will also be included in a future release.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Global Settings page that allows Administrator to select or deselect which options to appear when a user edits a page or post.
2. A User's TinyMCE Settings, that can be found at the bottom of the User-edit page. Tick the "Global Settings" checkbox to override a User's own settings.
